Implementations:

1A:

We implemented the read-command.c by first getting characters from the file and forming a buffer character array. Then, we go through the character array and use one operator stack and one command stack to keep track of the precedence of the operators and build the command tree. We have a store_simple_command and get_next_word auxiliary functions that help store the simple commands.
